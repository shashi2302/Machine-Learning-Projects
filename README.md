 Federated Mental Health Predictor

Mental health is a critical issue, and early intervention can save lives. 
Thatâ€™s why I built a privacy-preserving system that predicts mental health crises using wearable data (e.g., heart rate, sleep patterns, activity levels) without sharing raw data across users.

Why It Matters :
-Early detection of mental health crises.
-Empowers users with actionable insights while protecting their privacy.
-Reduces healthcare costs by enabling proactive care.

Tech Stack used: 
- Python 3.9+
- TensorFlow Federated
- TensorFlow Privacy
- Flask
- Pandas/Numpy
